  So if I use <img> tag to import the vector images in Html, instead of using background-image property, I wouldn't have the 
  problem of height getting reduced to 0, right?

  /* 1 more question please! I had the .page block's left and right padding removed in
 previous version at screen resolution of 620px which is when there isn't enough space
 to have 2 cards with border. When the padding disappeared at 620 there is enough space again
 and the grid made the cards go back to 2 columns. In this last submittion, I changed the 
 media-query in .page value to 590 so that the grid doesn't revert back.
 Is that corrrect?*/
